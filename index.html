        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>I'm a web developer first and foremost. 
            I like to try out a lot of different things from playing around
            with low-level and embedded programming,
            and doing some machine learning throughout my time
        <br>
            But web development is home - I enjoy working in it, I love to see
            how far the web has come, I would love to be part of pushing web
            development to be more inclusive and less shitty,
            and I'm pretty good at this :) 
        <br>my other interests include guitar and yoga (and category theory? lol)
