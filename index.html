                    <h2>About me (the professional)</h2>
                    <p>I'm a web developer first and foremost. 
                        I like to try out a lot of different things from playing around
                        with low-level and embedded programming,
                        and doing some machine learning throughout my time
                        <br>
                        But web development is home - I enjoy working in it, I love to see
                        how far the web has come, I would love to be part of pushing web
                        development to be more inclusive and less shitty,
                        and I'm pretty good at this :)
