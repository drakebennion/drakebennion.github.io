                        I know how to get down to business when the need arises. Among other things, I've:

                        I'm starting to get comfortable with the idea that
                        I'm a web developer first and foremost. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Web development is home to me, and I like to have fun doing it.
                        Javascript was my first language and has been a 
                        mainstay my whole career, and I've been really excited to see how fast the web
                        and web development in general has changed over the years.
                        I also have plenty of experience in microservices, more on that soon
                        I like to try out a lot of different things from playing around
                        with low-level and embedded programming,
                        and doing some machine learning throughout my time
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        But web development is home - I enjoy working in it, I love to see
                        how far the web has come, I would love to be part of pushing web
                        development to be more inclusive and less shitty,
                        and I'm pretty good at this :)
